External objects,"Global search only: Text, text area, and long text area fieldsNOTE
• Lookup search isn’t available for external lookup relationship fields. To edit an external lookup relationship field, manually enter the value of the External ID standard field for the parent record. This limitation doesn’t apply when the parent external object is associated with the cross-org adapter for Salesforce Connect.
• Lookup search isn’t available for indirect lookup relationship fields. To edit an indirect lookup relationship field, manually enter the value of the target field of the parent record. The target field is the custom field with External ID and Unique attributes that was selected when the indirect lookup relationship was created. To determine related records, Salesforce matches target field values against the values of the indirect lookup relationship field on the child object.
An external object accesses data that’s stored outside your Salesforce org. Your Salesforce admin controls which external objects are searchable. Which external object fields are searched depends on how the external system handles searches. If the search results aren’t as you expected, use case-sensitive search strings that contain only alphanumeric characters. If the results still aren’t as expected, contact your admin for recommendations on searching your specific external system."
