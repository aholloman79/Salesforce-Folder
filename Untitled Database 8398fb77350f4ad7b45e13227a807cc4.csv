Special Character,Description
",","Delimits values. For example, use JAN, MAR, APR to specify more than one month."
-,"Specifies a range. For example, use JAN-MAR to specify more than one month."
*,"Specifies all values. For example, if Month is specified as *, the job is scheduled for every month."
?,Specifies no specific value. This option is only available for Day_of_month and Day_of_week. It’s typically used when specifying a value for one and not the other.
/,"Specifies increments. The number before the slash specifies when the intervals will begin, and the number after the slash is the interval amount. For example, if you specify 1/5 for Day_of_month, the Apex class runs every fifth day of the month, starting on the first of the month."
L,"Specifies the end of a range (last). This option is only available for Day_of_month and Day_of_week. When used with Day of month, L always means the last day of the month, such as January 31, February 29 (for leap years), and so on. When used with Day_of_week by itself, it always means 7 or SAT. When used with a Day_of_week value, it means the last of that type of day in the month. For example, if you specify 2L, you’re specifying the last Monday of the month. Don’t use a range of values with L as the results can be unexpected."
W,"Specifies the nearest weekday (Monday-Friday) of the given day. This option is only available for Day_of_month. For example, if you specify 20W, and the 20th is a Saturday, the class runs on the 19th. If you specify 1W, and the first is a Saturday, the class doesn’t run in the previous month, but on the third, which is the following Monday.
Tip
Use the L and W together to specify the last weekday of the month."
#,"Specifies the nth day of the month, in the format weekday#day_of_month. This option is only available for Day_of_week. The number before the # specifies weekday (SUN-SAT). The number after the # specifies the day of the month. For example, specifying 2#1 means the class runs on the first Monday of every month."
